## Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, data scientists provide algorithms with labeled training data and define the variables they want the algorithm to assess for correlations. Both the input and output of the algorithm are specified in supervised learning. Initially, most machine learning algorithms worked with supervised learning, but unsupervised approaches are becoming popular.

**Definition:** Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where each input is paired with the corresponding output. The model learns to map inputs to outputs, enabling predictions on new, unseen data.

**Popular Algorithms:**
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
