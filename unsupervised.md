# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised machine learning algorithms donâ€™t require data to be labeled. They sift through unlabeled data to look for patterns that can be used to group data points into subsets. Most types of deep learning, including neural networks, are unsupervised algorithms.

**Definition:** Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, aiming to discover patterns, structures, or relationships within the data without explicit guidance.

**Popular Algorithms:**
- K-means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
